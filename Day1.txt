You asked: “What is Data Networking in short and with a real-time example?”
Here’s a clear and concise explanation:

✅ What is Data Networking?
Data networking refers to the digital infrastructure that allows devices (computers, servers, smartphones, etc.) to exchange information and share resources over wired or wireless connections. It uses standardized protocols to ensure data moves securely and efficiently across networks.

At its core, a data network consists of:

Clients – End-user devices like laptops or phones.
Servers – Systems storing and providing resources.
Transmission channels – Wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi).
Interface devices – Switches, routers, NICs.
Network software – Manages operations and security.
Data is transmitted using packet switching, where information is broken into packets, routed through network devices, and reassembled at the destination. This enables fast, reliable communication across local or global networks.

✅ Real-Time Example
Imagine video conferencing on Microsoft Teams:

Your voice and video are converted into data packets.
These packets travel through your LAN/Wi-Fi, then through routers and switches to the internet.
The packets reach the recipient’s device, where they are reassembled into audio and video streams.
This happens in milliseconds, enabling real-time communication.
Other examples:

Online gaming (low latency is critical).
Banking systems connecting multiple branches via WAN.
IoT devices sending sensor data instantly for monitoring.

The image illustrates a basic wireless communication process:

✅ What’s in the image?
Two communication towers with signal waves, representing wireless transmission.
A wired connection between the towers (possibly a backbone link).
Two end users on opposite sides, each with a smartphone.
The title: “Communication Processes”.
✅ What does it represent?
This is a simplified diagram of how data networking works in wireless communication:

User A sends data (voice, text, video) from a smartphone.
The data travels via wireless signals to the nearest tower.
Towers exchange data through a wired or fiber backbone.
The second tower transmits the data wirelessly to User B’s smartphone.
✅ Real-Time Example
Phone Call or Video Chat: When you make a WhatsApp call, your voice is converted into data packets, sent to the nearest cell tower, routed through the network backbone, and delivered to the recipient’s tower and phone.
Streaming Music: Your request goes through the same process to fetch data from servers.
Do you want me to annotate this image with labels (like “Sender”, “Receiver”, “Wireless Link”, “Backbone”) and give you a clear diagram of the data flow? Or should I create a more detailed networking architecture diagram for your course notes?

So the OSI model stands for Open Systems Interconnect. It's a model that was developed in the 70s in order to describe network operation. Now there's lots of different protocols involved in data networking, and what the OSI model did is it gave us a place to categorize each of these protocols, as well as give the exact order that those protocols need to be processed in. So if you remember this phone call I talked about in the previous module, the order of operations here were such that Leia had to vibrate the air, which vibrated the microphone, which converted it into electrical signals, which then got converted into wireless signals, which got converted into a different type of electrical signal, and so on, until that message reached Obi on the other side. Now, in order for that to happen, there is a very precise set of rules that need to happen and protocols that need to be followed in order for this conversation to successfully happen. Well, when we're working with data networking, it's almost exactly the same; we just have these different components involved versus our smartphones and our voice. We're going to be using a computer or a tablet or a smartphone, like maybe an internet browser on a smartphone, to do our communication. So let's introduce a drawing. Now I communicate a lot in these drawings with icons, so I'll introduce the drawings and all the icons we're using so that we can use that then to talk about the OSI model. So here we have a PC. This is our end‑user device. Sometimes this is called a client, sometimes it's called a workstation, PC. That's the device we're going to be using to surf the web. Now another device in our network, especially in our home network, is likely going to be this wireless router device. And this is the icon, the purple icon here is the icon that I'm using for a wireless router. And we can then connect our PC up to that wireless router. That router typically has some switchports on the back, so we can actually plug in a cable to that. Or we might be using it as a wireless device and actually not have any cables at all and just use the wireless communication to communicate between our workstation and the wireless access point. Now in order to get access to the internet, we need some type of device to bridge the network connection between our wireless access point and the internet, and that's where a modem comes in. So here is a modem. I showed you some real‑life pictures of this in the previous module. Here this teal icon is just a representation of that cable modem or any other type of modem that's going to connect you to the internet. So we're slowly building this network up. This is a representation of your home network. And then out on the internet, we have a bunch of servers out on the internet, and this icon is representing the servers, the orange icon there with the globe next to it. This is going to be the servers that contain all of the information that we are going to transfer from the server to our workstation so that we can read the news, surf Facebook or other social media, or maybe check our email. For the purposes of this, I'm going to avoid the wireless for this moment. We're going to come back and talk lots more about wireless in the future. But for now, I'm just going to connect my workstation to our network with a cable. So now we have this network, or this drawing of our basic network. Remember before I said that cloud represents a bunch of devices and protocols that we don't want to represent individually? And that's exactly what I'm doing here as well. That internet now is a cloud. It's thousands of devices that we're going to use to connect to our server to transfer information. So let's say that on my workstation I want to go to pluralsight.com. So I type that into my browser, and that's going to send a message to our Pluralsight server. The Pluralsight server is then going to grab the website that we're looking for, it's going to put that into a message, and then send it over to my workstation so that I can browse the videos on Pluralsight. So in order for that to happen, we need a very specific set of rules and orders of operations for this to happen. So if you start with the most basic things that we can see, we can see the cables that we're using. Now the cables don't have any special electronics in them, or at least most of them don't. They're typically just some wires with a special connector on the end so that we can plug them into things. But there's no special electronics in those devices. Those cables do follow protocols though. So the Ethernet cable that we use to connect our computer to our wireless access point there, or our switch, that cable follows a very precise set of rules on how it's constructed. It just doesn't have anything electronic in it. So all these cables that we have here are used to connect things together. There's even wireless cables. That might be our wireless connection in our home from our smartphone to the wireless access point. Or even out on the internet, there might be some connections that use a point‑to‑point wireless connection. These are also cables, in that they're used to transfer information, they follow a specific protocol, but it's not a device. It's actually the signal itself that we're talking about here. So in the case of the cables that connect our workstations together, these are called twisted pair cables. These twisted pair cables follow a very specific set of rules, which we'll learn about in a later module. Oftentimes connecting our server to the rest of the network we're going to use twisted pair cabling. Connecting our cable modem to the internet might use a coax cable. And then out on the internet here, we're likely going to be using fiber optics, or very thin strands of glass, in order to transfer our information. So all of these cables, these different cables, whether it be wireless, twisted pair, coax, fiber optics, all of these are technology that we use in order to transfer our data from one device to another. All of this stuff is happening at what we call the physical layer of the OSI model. The physical layer is also layer 1, and the physical layer is really what we're talking about when we're talking about cables, specifications for cables, whether that be wireless, copper, or glass. The next layer of the OSI model here is going to be used to have protocols that allow us to transfer bits of information over the cables. So there is a specific protocol called Ethernet that we use to transfer data from our workstation to the wireless router, from the wireless router to the cable modem, from the cable modem to wherever our internet provider is, from the server to our switches inside of our data center, and then numerous other protocols on the internet used to transfer information. So all these little circles that I have drawn here, those are representing different protocols that could be used to transfer data. And each one of these protocols is a little bit different, but they work together all at the same level. What I have circled here, the connection between my PC and the router, the router and the cable modem, and then the server and the rest of the internet, that's likely using Ethernet. The connection here between our cable modem and the rest of the internet is likely using a protocol called DOCSIS 3. Out on the internet it's mainly Ethernet, but there could be other protocols out there. All of these protocols, Ethernet, DOCSIS, are all part of the data link layer, and they provide all of the structure to be able to use the cables that are connected to it. So they provide the protocols and the rules, specifications for electronics, as well as how to create and move a message across those links. So that's layer 2 of our OSI model, is the data link layer. So the data link layer is facilitating communication within these circles that I have drawn on the screen. It's allowing us to pass data from one device to another. However, if I want to send a message to a device that's far away, that's not on my little local network, what I need to do is I need some other mechanism to do that. So I need another type of protocol in order to do this, so I might need to communicate between my PC and my cable modem, or I might need to communicate from the cable modem out to the internet someplace, or I might need to communicate, in this case, I will need to communicate, from my workstation all the way to Pluralsight servers and back again. So I need some way of sending a message from my workstation to Pluralsight and then getting it back, and this is where we use a protocol called Internet Protocol, and we use something called IP addressing. The IP addressing allows us as users to communicate with nearly any device on the internet. This is where IP addressing occurs, IP routing, and it is all the network layer, which is layer 3 of our OSI model. So far we have the physical layer, our cables, we have the data link layer, which are the protocols that allow our computer and other devices to communicate locally with other devices. Then we have layer 3, the network layer. That allows us to make use of the data link layer and physical layer to send messages long distances across a network. The next layer here we're going to talk about is, in order for us to have a conversation between our client, or workstation, and our server, where pluralsight.com's website is hosted, we need a way to build a session in between these two devices so that they can send information between each other and understand that the conversation is meant for specific things in that network communication. We're going to talk lots about this process. In fact, I have a whole other module that talks specifically about this process. But for now, let's go back to our cell phone example here, where we're making a phone call. Now we talked about kind of like the vibrating air and whatnot with this, but more so there's another way to look at this conversation. There's another protocol we follow, actually, in order to make this conversation work. I can't just pick up my smartphone and start talking and expect my friend Obi on the other end to listen. What I have to do is I have to dial a phone number for Obi, and then I have to wait for Obi's phone to ring. Once his phone is ringing, Obi can answer that phone, he's going to say hello, Leia here says hello, and once that happens then Leia can say, hey, I need some help. And Obi can say, oh, okay, and they can have that conversation. And my point here is that in order for Leia to be able to communicate with Obi, we have to go through that process of dialing the phone, waiting for it to ring, waiting for Obi to say hello, I say hello. And once that happens then I can send any information I want. Transmission Control Protocol does this in data networking. This is also called TCP, and what it does is it sets up a session between our workstation and the server so that we can send data between these two devices. This is the transport layer. So the transport layer in networking is responsible for setting up a session typically using TCP. It has a handshake process, and it builds a connection, and it uses the network layer to find where in the world those devices are. It uses the data link layer to communicate those messages from device to device to device to device until they reach their destinations, and that all happens on the physical layer, which is our wires and cables that connect our network together. Next, we need a way to transfer information that's in a usable format. One of those ways is to use a web browser and browse to a website like pluralsight.com and then retrieve a web page. The website is nothing more than a document with information in it. The web browser is an application that makes use of a protocol in order to request and transfer information. So in order to get the website to our workstation, we're going to make a request of the server to say, hey, send us the website. The server's going to respond with a document that is the website, and we're going to use a protocol called Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This is also known as HTTP, and it has a sibling called HTTPS, which is the encrypted version of it. Now, HTTP and HTTPS, they transfer documents that are written in a language called HyperText Markup Language, or HTML. So we're using HTTP to transfer HTML documents. So our website is written in some form of HTML, and we use HTTP or HTTPS to transfer those. So all of this is happening outside of our process of building a session between our two workstations or identifying the location of those devices with IP addresses or having protocols that allow us to transfer information from our computer to the router to the cable modem and so on. All this is happening at the application layer of the OSI model. Now the OSI model is seven layers, and you've noticed that I have skipped two of them. The OSI model was written in the 70s when they had different networking needs and other protocols involved here. So there's two layers that I have not talked about now, 5 and 6. So what's going on with that? Well, let's talk about it. First, let's talk about the presentation layer. The presentation layer is layer 6, and we don't really use the presentation layer anymore. And there's a reason for that. Back in the 70s, there were several types of systems. There were a lot of open source systems that universities used, and then IBM had systems as well, and IBM developed very proprietary protocols that were similar but different than the ones used in university settings. So let's say we have this message of "Don't Panic." Well, in order to create Don't Panic in a language that the computer understands and can encode, when we type on the keyboard, each one of these letters capital D, lowercase o, apostrophes, and whatnot, each of those is mapped to a hexadecimal value. It's a 8‑bit hexadecimal value, and it's called ASCII, A‑S‑C‑I‑I, which stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII is still used today. When we type on our keyboard, it is still translated to these values in ASCII you. So if I translate, Don't Panic to ASCII, I get the D = 44, o is 6F. We're going to learn about hexadecimal numbers in another couple modules here, so don't stress too much if these numbers look goofy because they have letters in them. We're going to talk about exactly why that is and a little bit. Just know that the numbers that I'm showing you here are actually numbers and not some other goofy language. So D is 44, o is 6F, n is 6e, the apostrophe is 27, t is 74, and so on, and when we put that all together we get this string of numbers that represents Don't Panic, including the space in there. In IBM‑land, they used a completely different number system in order to encode each key of the keyboard. So each keystroke that meant Don't Panic got encoded differently. And EBCDIC, E‑B‑C‑D‑I‑C, which stands for Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code, is IBM's version. It was their proprietary version. And in order for a system that used ASCII to communicate with a system that used EBCDIC, we needed some layer of the OSI model to translate from one system to the other, and that's what we intended to do with the presentation layer. Now that has all become quite antiquated, and we really don't do much with this anymore. You may find in textbooks that they're going to say, oh, JPEG and MPEG and whatnot happen at the presentation layer, and that might be the case. But really, those are outside of the OSI model, and we're ultimately going to be using application layer protocols in order to transfer information, and we really don't worry too much about the presentation layer. The session layer is another layer. I personally don't concern myself with the session layer too much. There are some protocols that do operate at the session layer. However, for networking purposes, we don't stress too much about classifying something as a session layer protocol. Ultimately, we consider it to be part of the application layer.Go through this and in short exaplain each and every point

Here’s a short and clear explanation of the key points from your text and the diagram:

✅ OSI Model Overview
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a 7-layer framework that standardizes how data moves across a network. Each layer has a specific role:

Layer 1 – Physical
Deals with cables, connectors, wireless signals.
Examples: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, Wi-Fi signals.
In the diagram: The arrows labeled Cables represent this layer.
Layer 2 – Data Link
Responsible for local communication between devices.
Uses protocols like Ethernet, DOCSIS.
Ensures data frames move across the physical medium.
Layer 3 – Network
Handles IP addressing and routing.
Protocol: Internet Protocol (IP).
Allows communication beyond local network (e.g., PC to Pluralsight server).
Layer 4 – Transport
Ensures reliable delivery of data.
Protocol: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).
Sets up sessions using a handshake process.
Layer 5 – Session
Manages sessions between devices.
Rarely used explicitly today; often integrated into application protocols.
Layer 6 – Presentation
Translates data formats (e.g., ASCII vs EBCDIC).
Mostly obsolete now; modern apps handle this internally.
Layer 7 – Application
Where user-facing protocols operate.
Examples: HTTP/HTTPS for websites, SMTP for email.
In the diagram: Typing https://www.pluralsight.com/ in the browser uses this layer.
✅ Real-Life Flow (Pluralsight Example)
User types URL → Application Layer (HTTP/HTTPS).
TCP handshake → Transport Layer.
IP routing → Network Layer.
Ethernet frames → Data Link Layer.
Signals over cables/wireless → Physical Layer.
Request reaches Pluralsight server, response sent back through the same layers.
